    <p>
        ...you are in trouble, feel lost or don't understand something specific, or...<br />
        ...you need a laugh; I can crack a good (in my opinion, some might differ) joke, or...<br />
        ...you don't know where to look for an information; I will do my best to guide you without providing you the straight answer, or...<br />
        ...you need someone to talk to; I believe I am a good listener, and I want to help if I can !

    <h2> A funny story </h2>
    <p>
        When I was in 3rd grade, we went for a school trip in the Dutch part of Belgium. Already at the time, I was known for disliking the language, but it was a mandatory trip so I just rolled along, trying to not appear too much bored. Suddenly, my knee gave up and I could not walk anymore; I had to be put in a train to get back home early. I had to get a few days rest so I couldn't attend school either afterwards. <br />
        However, the school believed that I did not have any problem with my knee and that it was all a scene in order to disturb the school trip. In the end, they ended up expelling me from the school due to that.
    </p>
    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
    <p>My knee gave up during a school trip, and I got expelled from the school for it.</p>
